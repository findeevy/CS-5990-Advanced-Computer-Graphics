**<code>AcceleRender</code>** is a modern, Vulkan-driven real-time rendering engine written in **C++20** using full RAII abstractions. <br> <br>
It manages the *entire GPU rendering pipeline* — from device selection and swap chain orchestration to shader compilation, texture streaming, and multi-frame synchronization — while exposing a clean, high-level API for rendering 3D scenes efficiently.

## Technical Context

This work is part of an **independent graduate research project** (CS:5990 - Individualized Research / Programming Project) conducted by **Finley Deevy** (MCS '27, University of Iowa) and **Eric Newton** (MCS '27, University of Iowa), focusing on high-performance GPU rendering and real-time profiling. The project was self-proposed and approved for graduate research credit, conducted under the supervision of **Dr. Peng Jiang** within the **Iowa High Performance Computing (IOWA-HPC)** research group, where progress is presented monthly.

## Current Features

- Real-time Vulkan renderer (RAII-managed, no manual `vkDestroy*`)
- Vertex/index buffers with staging + texture loading w/ mipmaps
- Depth buffering & MSAA (anti-aliasing)
- Automatic GPU/device selection & memory allocation
- Swap chain + framebuffer management w/ safe resize handling
- Efficient command buffer recording & CPU/GPU synchronization
- Integrated real-time profiler (frame timing)

## CPU Profiling

**<code>ChronoProfiler</code>** is a lightweight CPU profiler built entirely from scratch using the C++ standard library. <br> <br>
It tracks **frame-by-frame CPU usage**, measures execution time for code zones, and safely handles **multi-threaded workloads** — all without external dependencies.

### Key Features
- **Scoped RAII zones:** Wrap code with `ScopedZone` or `ScopedFrame` to profile automatically.  
- **Thread-safe:** Uses thread-local storage and mutexes to merge events per frame.  
- **Aggregated stats:** Reports average, max, and total time per zone.  
- **JSON export:** Save profiling sessions for offline analysis.  

### ProfilerUI
- Displays rolling frame history as **ASCII bars**.  
- Shows **aggregated statistics** for all tracked zones.  
- Updates safely in real-time alongside your multi-threaded application.

## Compilation
Run the makefile after installing the [dependencies](#dependencies).  
This builds both the shaders and the executable.

Compatible with:
- Arch Linux (RTX 3050 Ti, Titan Xp)
- macOS (Apple M1)

### Common Build Commands

```bash
# clean old build artifacts
make clean

# compile shaders only
make shaders

# build the project
make

# build with profiling enabled
make PROFILING=1

# generate documentation
make docs
```

## Dependencies
- **[Vulkan SDK](https://www.vulkan.org)** — core rendering backend
- **[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org)** — windowing + Vulkan surface creation
- **[GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)** — math library (matrices, vectors, transforms)
- **[STB Image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)** — texture loading

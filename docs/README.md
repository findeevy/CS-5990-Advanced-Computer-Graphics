## Compilation:
Run the makefile after installing the [dependencies](#dependencies) to compile the shaders as well as the executable. This has been tested on both Arch Linux (RTX 3050ti, Titan Xp) and macOS (Apple M1).

## Current Features:
- Depth buffering.
- Fragment/vertex shader support.
- Window resizing.
- Texture mapping.
- Discrete graphics device selection.
- GPU/CPU memory management (staging buffer).
- Swap chain and frame buffer management.
- CPU/GPU synchronization.
- Error checking.
